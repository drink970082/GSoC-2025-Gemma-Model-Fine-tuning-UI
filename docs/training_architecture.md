# Gemma Fine-Tuning Architecture

## System Overview

The Gemma Fine-Tuning system provides a streamlined interface for monitoring and controlling the fine-tuning process of Gemma language models. The system focuses on real-time monitoring, visualization, and process management during training.

## Core Components

### 1. Training Process Management
- **Process Controller**
  - Manages training process lifecycle
  - Handles TensorBoard server
  - Ensures proper cleanup of resources
  - Monitors process health

### 2. Monitoring System
- **Real-time Metrics**
  - Training metrics (loss, accuracy)
  - Performance metrics (steps/sec, data points/sec)
  - System metrics (GPU usage, memory)
- **TensorBoard Integration**
  - Direct TensorBoard visualization
  - Real-time metric logging
  - Custom metric tracking

### 3. User Interface
- **Dashboard**
  - Real-time training metrics
  - System resource monitoring
  - Training logs
  - TensorBoard iframe integration
- **Controls**
  - Start/Stop training
  - Process management
  - Status monitoring

## Training Process Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Start TensorBoard server
   - Initialize monitoring systems
   - Prepare resource tracking

2. **Training Start**
   - Launch training process
   - Begin metric collection
   - Start real-time monitoring

3. **During Training**
   - Collect and log metrics
   - Monitor system resources
   - Update UI in real-time
   - Stream TensorBoard data

4. **Monitoring and Visualization**
   - Display training progress
   - Show system metrics
   - Stream training logs
   - Update TensorBoard views

5. **Completion/Interruption**
   - Stop metric collection
   - Clean up resources
   - Save final metrics
   - Shutdown TensorBoard

## Technical Implementation

### Process Management
```python
class ProcessManager:
    def start_training():
        # Launch training process
        # Start TensorBoard
        # Initialize monitoring

    def stop_training():
        # Stop training process
        # Clean up resources
        # Save final state
```

### Metrics Collection
```python
def collect_metrics():
    # Training metrics
    - Loss values
    - Performance stats
    - System resources

def update_visualization():
    # Update UI components
    - Real-time plots
    - System metrics
    - Training logs
```

### TensorBoard Integration
```python
def setup_tensorboard():
    # Start TensorBoard server
    # Configure logging
    # Set up iframe display
```
